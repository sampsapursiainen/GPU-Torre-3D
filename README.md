# GPU-Torre-3D
Full-wave radar simulation and inversion software tool.

GPU-ToRRe-3D is a numerical toolbox for investigating mathematical non-linear tomographic radar inverse imaging problems. It aims at enabling fast and robust inversion of sparse full-wave tomography data. The forward approach utilizes a higher-order Born approximation (BA) to account for complex wave scattering inside the computational domain. The forward modelling approach uses a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated finite element time-domain (FETD) method. In the inversion stage, a GPU-computed multigrid-FETD deconvolution routine is applied to enhance computational performance.
