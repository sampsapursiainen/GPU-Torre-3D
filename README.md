# GPU-Torre-3D
Full-wave radar simulation and inversion software tool.

GPU-Torre and GPU-Torre-3D are oben Matlab-based toolboxes for numerical investigation of mathematical non-linear tomographic radar inverse imaging problems in 2D and 3D. They aim at enabling fast and robust inversion of sparse full-wave tomography data. The forward modelling approach applies a graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerated finite element time-domain (FETD) method and Born approximation (BA) to account for complex wave scattering inside the computational domain. In the inversion stage, a GPU-computed multigrid-FETD deconvolution routine is utilized to enhance computational performance. GPU-Torre frontend provides a graphical inter
